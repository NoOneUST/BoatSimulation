# BoatSimulation
An original and useful code for boat simulation
---

    'Discrete3DHull.py' is the main file. You can use it to initialize a 3D boat with an arbitary function and to add ballasts and masts to your boat. After this, you will be able to calculate the center of mass and center of buoyancy of your boat, with which you can obtain its waterline and righting moment. In the end, the program will tell you whether your boat is stable and give you some instinct results.


    'plotAlgebraic3DHull.py' is a program file with which you can visualize any algebric boat you want.


    Enjoy this program! 


    I know very clearly that this program is still far from maturation. If you have any questions or find any bugs, please feedback to me via email lwangcg@connect.ust.hk.
